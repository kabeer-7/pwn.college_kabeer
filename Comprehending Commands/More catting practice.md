# Comprehending Commands

## More catting practice
Add challenge description here

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{cILS5VUwpNB0kK4UkEenfnbD8VB.QXwITO0wSN2gjNzEzW}`

I entered the cat command with the given absolute path as the argument to run the flag file which returns the required flag to me. 
```bash
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cat /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/engines-1.1/flag
pwn.college{cILS5VUwpNB0kK4UkEenfnbD8VB.QXwITO0wSN2gjNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
Nothing new learnt on top of the previous challenge other than accessing more directories to read the required file using cat. 

### References 
None.
