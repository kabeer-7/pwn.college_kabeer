# Comprehending Commands

## Catting absolute paths
We are to read the flag using cat at its absolute path which is given as /flag

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{wBumbihe44cY7ekzPnpD2DLk0Z_.QX5ETO0wSN2gjNzEzW}`

I simply enter cat with the path i.e, /flag to obtain the requried flag. 

```bash
hacker@commands~catting-absolute-paths:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{wBumbihe44cY7ekzPnpD2DLk0Z_.QX5ETO0wSN2gjNzEzW}

```

### New Learnings
I learnt how to use cat to read files at its absolute path with the argument of the cat command being the absolute path. 

### References 
None.
