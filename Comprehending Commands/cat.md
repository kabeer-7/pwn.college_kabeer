# Comprehending Commands

## Cat
We are to read the flag from a file 'flag' in the home directory using the cat command. 

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{EGU53jMew7QqxGO0tAA0hxwtbPr.QXxcTN0wSN2gjNzEzW}`

I simply read the flag using cat in the given 'flag' file in the home directory. 

```bash
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$ cat flag
pwn.college{EGU53jMew7QqxGO0tAA0hxwtbPr.QXxcTN0wSN2gjNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
I learnt about the usage of the cat command. Cat is used to join multiple files i.e, concatenate them and display the content of the files. 

### References
