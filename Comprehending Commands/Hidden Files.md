# Comprehending Commands

## Hidden Files
We need to find the hidden flag, hidden as a dot-prepended file in /. 

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{helloworld}`

I use the ls command with the -a flag to see all the files including the ones which start with a '.'. 

```bash
command 1
command 2
pwn.college{helloworld}
```
