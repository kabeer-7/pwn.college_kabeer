# Hello Hackers

## Intro to Commands
We learn to invoke a command. We invoke the hello command to get the required flag. 

### Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{ctwmBT0uyQe2gnBELNqXqmXgvq2.QX3YjM1wSN2gjNzEzW}

We execute the hello command. We are expected to get the prompt of "Hello" or "Hello, World" but we get our flag when we execute the command. 

```bash
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{ctwmBT0uyQe2gnBELNqXqmXgvq2.QX3YjM1wSN2gjNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
I learnt how to execute a command in a linux command line. I learnt that a command is the instruction given to the system and opon entering, the system runs the command and displays the output. We get the prompt after the output is displayed, prompt basically indicates us to input the next command.
