# Terminal Multiplexing

## Launching screen
We are supposed to use screen which will give us the flag. 

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{sm77sunasnEQ3-mpDC0T_UIVE9x.0VN4IDOxwSN2gjNzEzW}`

I just entered screen which made a virtual terminal and gave me the flag on continuing. After which, I typed exit to leave the screen session.

```bash
hacker@terminal-multiplexing~launching-screen:~$ screen
Congratulations! You're inside a screen session!
Here's your flag:
pwn.college{sm77sunasnEQ3-mpDC0T_UIVE9x.0VN4IDOxwSN2gjNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
I learnt about screen which basically lets us create multiple virtual terminal windows within the original session.
