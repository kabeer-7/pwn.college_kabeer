# Practising Piping

## Appending output
We are to append the output of the program to a file since the flag has been divided into two. 

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{omLdGKe69K1CMdix5QMR75Kvs8v.QX3ATO0wSN2gjNzEzW}`

I first added the first half of the flag by redirecting the output of the /challenge/run program to the file using >. After which I appended the second half of the flag by using >> instead of > and redirecting the output. This added the complete flag to the file which I could access upon using cat to read the file. 

```bash
hacker@piping~appending-output:~$ /challenge/run > /home/hacker/the-flag
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge will check that output is redirected to a specific file path : /home/hacker/the-flag

[HYPE] ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] Good luck!

[TEST] You should have redirected my stdout to a file called /home/hacker/the-flag. Checking...

[HINT] File descriptors are inherited from the parent, unless the FD_CLOEXEC is set by the parent on the file descriptor.
[HINT] For security reasons, some programs, such as python, do this by default in certain cases. Be careful if you are
[HINT] creating and trying to pass in FDs in python.

[PASS] The file at the other end of my stdout looks okay!
[PASS] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements.
I will write the flag in two parts to the file /home/hacker/the-flag! I'll do 
the first write directly to the file, and the second write, I'll do to stdout 
(if it's pointing at the file). If you redirect the output in append mode, the 
second write will append to (rather than overwrite) the first write, and you'll 
get the whole flag!
hacker@piping~appending-output:~$ stdout >> /home/hacker/the-flag
bash: stdout: command not found
hacker@piping~appending-output:~$ /challenge/run >> /home/hacker/the-flag

hacker@piping~appending-output:~$ cat /home/hacker/the-flag 
 | 
\|/ This is the first half:
 v 
pwn.college{omLdGKe69K1CMdix5QMR75Kvs8v.QX3ATO0wSN2gjNzEzW}
                              ^
     that is the second half /|\
                              |

If you only see the second half above, you redirected in *truncate* mode (>) 
rather than *append* mode (>>), and so the write of the second half to stdout 
overwrote the initial write of the first half directly to the file. Try append 
mode!
```

### New Learnings
I learnt about the two types of output redirection: standard and append. Standard rewrites the output to the file given while append appends the output to the file at the end. 

### References 
I used google to read about > and >>.
