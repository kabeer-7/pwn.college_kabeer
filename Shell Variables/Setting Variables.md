# Shell variables

## Setting Variables
We are supposed to set the PWN variable to the value COLLEGE.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Ixg8buypgnNELdKbAfUCow_5gBg.QX5UTN0wSN2gjNzEzW}`

I simply entered PWN=COLLEGE which sets PWN's value to COLLEGE therefore completing the challenge and giving me the flag. 

```bash
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{Ixg8buypgnNELdKbAfUCow_5gBg.QX5UTN0wSN2gjNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
I learnt how to set values to variables and how we are not supposed to use spaces as that would make the shell read the variable as a command. 

### References 
None.
