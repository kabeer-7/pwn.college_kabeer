# Shell variables

## Multi-word variables
We are supposed to set variable PWN to COLLEGE YEAH. 

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Q4Ix2NlCo5pYV_a7i2F5WTNHOtL.QXwYTN0wSN2gjNzEzW}`

```bash
hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$ PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{Q4Ix2NlCo5pYV_a7i2F5WTNHOtL.QXwYTN0wSN2gjNzEzW}

```

### New Learnings
I learnt how we can set values with spaces to variables using quotations which makes the shell read it as one token. 

### References 
None.
