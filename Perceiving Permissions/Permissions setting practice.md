# Perceiving permissions

## Permissions setting practice
Another game to find the flag similar to the previous one. 

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{ApPl1vYEzv8hxdT4_F5sidX9eFd.QXzETO0wSN2gjNzEzW}`

I did the same thing as the previous game but just used = as well as the changes were more. 

```bash
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ /challenge/run

- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
* the world does have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ chmod u+r /flag
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{ApPl1vYEzv8hxdT4_F5sidX9eFd.QXzETO0wSN2gjNzEzW}
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$
