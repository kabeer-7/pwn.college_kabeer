# File Globbing

## Tab Completion
We are supposed to read /challenge/pwncollege using cat without entering the complete file name but using tab. 

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{coS2FPZEUaCpC0-YvrUdmxre-2k.0FN0EzNxwSN2gjNzEzW}`

I entered cat /challenge/p and then hit tab to auto-complete the file name and executed the command to read the flag.

```bash
hacker@globbing~tab-completion:~$ cat /challenge/pwncollegeâ€‹ 
pwn.college{coS2FPZEUaCpC0-YvrUdmxre-2k.0FN0EzNxwSN2gjNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
Nothing new learnt as I was aware about using tab using the terminal in the past. 

### References 
none.
