## Tab completion on commands
We are supposed to tab complete a command that starts with pwncollege.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{4XlHRzTMlsRm-dAy5MaVqXqFTQX.0VN0EzNxwSN2gjNzEzW}`

I enter pwncollege and hit tab which autocompletes the command. Running the command gives me the required flag.

```bash
hacker@globbing~tab-completion-on-commands:~$ pwncollege-12990 
Correct! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4XlHRzTMlsRm-dAy5MaVqXqFTQX.0VN0EzNxwSN2gjNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
Got to know that commands can be auto-completed but the commands must be checked just in case we don't end up entering the wrong command. 

### References 
None.
